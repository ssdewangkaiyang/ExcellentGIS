Complaining a bit, for students from colleges without a remote sensing doctoral program, if you want to pursue a PhD, don't take the dead end route. Don't just rely on remote sensing. Leave yourself some backup plans, such as: 1. Becoming a vocational teacher. 2. Becoming a programmer. 3. Taking civil service exams. 4. Communicating with your family to explore other career paths available.
